# The History of Larkhollow
Larkhollow cove was founded in the 1800s By Ava Grace Machado and the Moss twins Bridgette and Kiernan, Larkhollow started a retreat for designers and theorists feeling the industrail boom. They bridged art and engineering. By the 1850s, the village became a refuge for quirky people and creators. Larkhollow was hidden from the normal modern worlds for years due to it having no major roads to lead people there. The towns motto has remaind the same ever since: _" The hand obeys the mind, the world follows."
